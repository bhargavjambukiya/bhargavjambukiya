Phyllo-insta:
This project revolves around developing a Google Chrome extension for Instagram, aiming to streamline the experience for influencers, advertisers, and campaign managers. As the Technical Lead and full-stack developer, I integrated Python (FastAPI) for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend.

The extension tracks real-time Instagram data and presents it through interactive graphs. Key metrics such as engagement rates, follower trends, age distribution, and gender demographics are visualized, empowering users to make informed decisions swiftly. This tool enhances user insights and facilitates strategic planning by providing clear visibility into performance metrics, thereby optimizing social media strategies effectively.

As the Tech Lead for BuilderCRM, I enhanced software development efficiency by implementing Agile methodologies and optimizing team workflows. I mentored junior developers, cultivating a culture of continuous learning and skill enhancement within the team. By streamlining code review processes, I elevated overall code quality and significantly reduced the time spent on revisions. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in designing and constructing databases and table structures essential for robust web applications, ensuring scalability and performance optimization.
